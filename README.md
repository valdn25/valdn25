## 📂 Featured Repos
Swap-Tech was created for the Spring 2025 'Tech for Civic Change Hackathon'. The purpose of Swap-Tech is to encourage sustainability by benefiting both everyday consumers and engineers. On our site, everyday buyers, or recyclers, can sell their old/unusable technology, and engineers, or refurbishers, can buy the old devices. Refurbishers can then fix and resell devices for recyclers to purchase. For this project, I drafted our site through Figma then translated the mockup into HTML and CSS.

**Unable to Make Public**
- Using object orienting principles, I created a Connect Four game with customizable board size to be played between a player and AI mode with win/tie detection logic.
